Given the effects of some process, is it possible to compute the causes?\nExamples include but are not limited to:\n\n- Determining an unkown filter from an input signal and an output signal.\n- Deblurring a blurry image.\n- Medical imaging.\n- Geophysical imaging.\n- Surface reconstruction from gradients or other information.\n- Kernel based operator machine learning.\n- Given a \"smooth\" painting, and the strokes the artist used, can we recover what the paint brush \"looks like\" everywhere?\n- Precision optical surfacing.\n\n\nSurprisingly, the mathematical and computational steps used to solve the above problems are\nvery similar and in some cases exactly the same. I was inspired to learn more about this topic based on\nengineering work I did at Optimax Systems Inc. I am also passionate about teaching, and my hope is to someday have a\nlecture series about many different mathematical topics ranging from Linear Algebra, to Differential Equations,\nCalculus, Statistics, Real Analysis, Topology, Image Processing... because I truly believe that teaching a subject is\nthe best way to learn and develop expertise. I have a very direct and straighforward style which I believe is helpful\nwhen students are first learning new topics. Right now this website is very bareboned, but over time expect it to grow!\n\nBest regards,\n\nNate\n\n</div>\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<style>\n.page-center {\n  max-width: 800px;\n  margin-left: auto;\n  margin-right: auto;\n  padding-left: 1rem;\n  padding-right: 1rem;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"page-center\">\n\nHello there!\n\nMy name is Nate Whybra, and I am a mathematician and computational scientist.\nI made this website to help me document my personal projects and to also share my thoughts about the mathematical\ntopics I am interested in.
